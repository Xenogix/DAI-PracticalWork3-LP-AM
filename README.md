# Practical Work 3 - Arthur Men√©trey & Lionel Pollien

## Introduction

This program allows you to play a multiplayer game based on the famous game "Snake."
In this game, you will have to survive against other players and eat apples to gain points.
You can choose to host a game server locally or join a server and play with friends!
Please be aware this game can only be played on a LAN as it uses UDP for client-to-server communication.

## Protocol

In this section, we will detail everything you should know about the protocol the game uses.
This protocol is very versatile and allows you to customize the game however you want!

### Overview

The main purpose of the protocol is to be able to receive the inputs from the player and send updates about the game.
This is why we are using UDP as this allows for fast data transition at a high rate.
The inputs of the player are sent to the server using unicast, and the updates are sent to every listening device on the network using multicast.

### Transport Mechanism

As this protocol needs to send a lot of data about the state of the game, we are using an object-oriented approach.
This means we are transmitting data as JSON through the network.

### Commands

The protocol uses the following commands :

| Type        | Parameters       | From   | To     | Transport | Description                                                                              |
|-------------|------------------|--------|--------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JOIN        | player data      | Client | Server | Unicast   | Ask the server to join the game                                                          |
| INPUT       | client id, input | Client | Server | Unicast   | Ask the server to process the given input for the given player                           |
| ACCEPT      | client id        | Server | Client | Unicast   | Accept the player join request and send a player id back                                 |
| ACKNOWLEDGE | <none>           | Server | Client | Unicast   | Acknowledge the player input command                                                     |
| REFUSE      | error message    | Server | Client | Unicast   | Refuse the request when the it cannot be performed (I.E refuse JOIN when a game is full) |
| UPDATE      | game data        | Server | Client | Multicast | Send the state of the game to every listener on the network                              |

The parameter's formats will be described in the next paragraph.

### Data format

The data is sent as json through the network as it allows transmitting heterogeneous objects through the network.
The main object is the command object that has the following structure :

```json

{
  "commandType": "<COMMAND TYPE>",
  "value":{
    
  }
}

```
